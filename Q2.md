# Problem 2: Counting Paths in Maze
Consider a 2-dimensional array as maze containing 0 and 1, zero means a path and 1 means blocked
path. You need to count all possible paths someone can take in maze to reach the end. The starting
location is (0,0) and end location is (n,m). You can only move right and down for reaching the
destination.
# Input file 
format: The first line of the input file contains two integers n and m both can be 0 <
n,m < 10, The maze is available from next line containing first row of m cells. Remember each
cell can contain 0 or 1.
# Output file format: 
The first line of the output file contains possible paths p as integer. If there is
no path you should write “No Path” in the file.
